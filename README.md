SPL (Signal Processing Library) Is a full template library aiming at providing Signal processing tools. SPL is based on SCOOP (https://www.lrde.epita.fr/dload/papers/mpool03.pdf & http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR542.pdf). The idea behind SCOOP programming is to provide static information for both programmer and compiler in order to produce generic and optimized code.
